In order to simulate EEG readings, no software exists which can run the Kinetic LGN model. 
This python library will simulate implements the kinetic lgn model for simulating eeg models.


1. Run simulation via:
python3 simulation_model.py
2. Determine change in params of a new activity: gaming in this eg.
python3 altering.py
3. EEG recordings in emotive_recordings folder
4. Consulted research papers(for reference) in docs


altering.py:
To alter the eeg signals generated by the simulation model to match with the standard eeg data so as to compare the simulated output EEG readings with the standard ones.

running_tests.py:
Plots standard and simulated EEG readings, for user to test hooks and nooks.

preprocessing_eeg.py:
Cleans the standard EEG data, the one with which we want to match the sample and the simulated readings.

simulation_model.py:
Implements the Kinetic LGN Model
